## Hi there 👋
I'm a Software Test Automation Specialist. I develop E2E, component, and API tests for both web and mobile applications using frameworks like Cypress, Playwright, CucumberJS, and Maestro. My ISO 9001:2015 quality background enables me to approach software testing not only technically but also from a process perspective.
